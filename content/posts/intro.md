## Introduction
Hi, I'm Scott Brown this post is going to be a bit of a mess. I'm a software developer in my 40s and feel like I'm in a pretty good spot in my life. I started my career in software development and pivoted to a sys admin role. I was fortunate enough to work in a smaller company which really let me learn a little bit about everything. I grew a lot in that role, but never felt like I was happy in it. 

A few years ago, I was offered another software development job and took a leap of faith and switched jobs. It's one of the best decisions I've ever made. I work with a lot of really bright people and even though I feel imposter syndrome all the time, I've started to realize I actually have a little to bring to the table. Where I'm rusty with software development, I found I can communicate pretty well with everyone and how much of an asset that can be.

Anyway, one suggestion I've seen a lot is to start writing about what I learn, and this is my attempt at it. I'll likely throw in other posts about interests like music or running, we'll just see how it goes.
